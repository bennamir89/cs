I'm an AS & A2 Computer Science teacher with 10 years experience teaching Computer Science and Information Communication Technology. I'm using an A Level Computer Science 9618 textbook from Hodder Education as my primary resource for teaching. I’m teaching students from China who need to learn the subject in English. At the same time there are some students who are weak in English and need assistance in Mandarin. 
Create website for my students which i can deploy on Github and have these functionality
Upload my resources/slides online and the students can download it
Have sidebar which have each chapter of the syllabus and their sub unit - which students can click and have a note which i can write on that later
